                I am a fullstack developer and have been living in Folsom, California for over 20 years.
            </p>
            <p> Previous to becoming a fullstack developer I designed computer chips. I was at for Intel for nearly 20 years, where 
            I worked on chipsets and later developing the internal graphics for CPUs. Before Intel, I worked for ARM, in CPU design.
            </p>
            <p> I moved from England to the United States in 1996, but some of my accent is still present.
            </p>
            <p>
            My degree, from Bristol University in England, is in Computer Systems Engineering, where I achieved first class honours.
            </p>
            <p>I have two children, and with whatever time I have left I enjoy the outdoors - hiking, cycling and skiing</p>
